Task 7 - Read a File and Handle Errors 
I have created a text file with 2 lines and tried reading that using the python code
The function read_file(file_path) reads a file line by line and prints each line.
It uses a try-except block to handle errors like missing files or I/O issues.
The print(line, end='') avoids adding extra newlines when printing.
It is tested with 'sample.txt', which prints the file's content in the Shell.

Task 8 - Write and Append Data to a File
As per the direction i have written a code that Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
Added additional data to the same file.
finally Reads and displays the final content of the file.
